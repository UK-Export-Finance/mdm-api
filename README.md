### Writing Conventional Commits

The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:

1. `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a [SemVer](https://semver.org/) **patch**.
2. `feat:` which represents a new feature, and correlates to a [SemVer](https://semver.org/) **minor**.
3. `feat!:`, `fix!:` or `refactor!:`, etc., which represent a breaking change (indicated by the `!`) and will result in a [SemVer](https://semver.org/) **major**.
